# physics-finance-mental-models

Exploring physics, finance, psychology, and AI to understand complex systems.

## Purpose
This repository is a personal workspace for understanding how complex systems behave across multiple domains. The goal is not immediate profit, but to build a framework that connects different ways of thinking and problem-solving.

## Current Focus
- Translating abstract physics concepts into computational models
- Understanding financial systems through data and behavior analysis
- Exploring psychological and decision-making patterns
- Using AI as a tool to simulate or analyze complex phenomena

## Experiments & Notes
- Initial experiments in Python: simulating simple physical systems
- Collecting and organizing datasets related to finance and decision-making
- Documenting insights from psychological and philosophical frameworks
- Small AI models to test ideas and validate assumptions

## Long-Term Goal
- Build a coherent framework connecting physics, finance, psychology, and AI
- Create assets (tools, notebooks, explanations) that demonstrate thinking and analysis capabilities
- Eventually, provide value to others through insights, consulting, or educational content
